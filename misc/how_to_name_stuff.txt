"PascalCase" for category. "snake_case" if it is an item of the category.

For example, "Pictures/Wallpapers/img.png":
1. "Pictures" is the super category.
2. Is "Wallpapers" a picture? No, it should use "PascalCase".
3. Is "img.png" a picture? Yes, it should use "snake_case".

Other Considerations:
1. Duplicates should be annotated with a suffix like so "folder-1", "folder-2" and so on.
2. games stuff or not quite stuff
