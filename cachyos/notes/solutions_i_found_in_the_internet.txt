- problem -> solution

- Godot misbehaving on right click -> run "godot-mono --single-window"
- Unable to over/under clock/volt? -> append "amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff" as a kernel parameter
- android studio emulator slow -> "QuickbootFileBacked = off" >> ~/.android/advancedFeatures.ini
- vscode / vscodium keys are not being interpreted correctly ->"keyboard.dispatch": "keyCode"
- libreoffice spell check not worky worky -> install hunspell-es_es
- fps capped? -> https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ce9sc8/having_issues_trying_to_uncap_my_fps_in_fallout_76/ && Create a "dxvk.conf" with "dxgi.syncInterval = 0" at the same level of ".exe".
